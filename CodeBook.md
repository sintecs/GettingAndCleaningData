## Study Design
This is the culmination of the course project for the Coursera class, Getting and Cleaning Data.  
The project consisted of obtaining the data from two given URLs, combining the two data sets, perform some organization and cleaning of the data and finally returning a "tidy" dataset.
The data used for this project was taken from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and then description of the study that created the data set used is located here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

The study for the Coursera Project performed the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
